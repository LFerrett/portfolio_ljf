# LJF Portfolio

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a starter page for my future portfolio in order to showcase my skills and talents. In particular, this project was built using what I learned in class about flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I also did some research on more advanced css implementation to better design my page.
